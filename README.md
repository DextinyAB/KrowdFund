Hello Beaker Example
--------------------

An example to show the use of a [Beaker](https://beaker.algo.xyz) application to do some of the work for us when building a front end.


### Get it

1) download the beaker repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:algorand-devrel/hello-beaker.git
# Or 
git clone https://github.com/algorand-devrel/hello-beaker.git
```

2) install dependencies 

```
cd hello-beaker
yarn #installs stuff
```

### Run Frontend

start the yarn dev server

```sh
yarn run dev
```

## Modify the Contract

### Get Beaker

Install [beaker-pyteal](https://github.com/algorand-devrel/beaker) python package to work with contracts

```sh
cd contracts
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install beaker-pyteal
```

### Regenerate the Application Spec

The `hello.py` file contains a method call to `dump` the application spec generated by the `HelloBeaker` application

```sh
python hello.py
# ... writes to `./artifacts`
```

### Rebuild the client

Use the [beaker-ts](https://github.com/algorand-devrel/beaker-ts) client generator to generate a client we can use in our front end to interact with the application

```sh
yarn run rebuild 
# ... generates the client in src/hellobeaker_client.ts from contracts/artifacts/HelloBeaker.json
```
